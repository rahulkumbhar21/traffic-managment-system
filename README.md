# traffic-managment-system

The proposed Fine-tuned Modified Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network) implementation system seeks to improve the effectiveness and safety of traffic obstacle identification. This automated system uses machine learning algorithms based on the ResNet-50 architecture, using a set of images for testing and training. Accurate traffic element identification and localization are made possible by the Faster R-CNN object detection model. The model's performance is improved by the application of strategies including Stochastic Gradient Descent, Cross-Entropy, and Fine-tuning, yielding an accuracy rate of 98.26%. In real-time circumstances, the model creates precise bounding boxes around things it detects, opening the door to a more automated and secure transportation system.
