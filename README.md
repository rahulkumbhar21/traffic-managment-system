## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Fine-tuned Modified Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network)** system designed to enhance traffic obstacle identification and promote safer, smarter transportation infrastructure.

Built upon the **ResNet-50 backbone**, this model utilizes advanced object detection techniques to accurately detect and localize traffic elements like vehicles in real-time scenarios.

> ✅ Achieved an accuracy of **98.26%**  
> ✅ Real-time obstacle detection with precise bounding boxes  
> ✅ Custom fine-tuning using **Stochastic Gradient Descent** and **Cross-Entropy Loss**
